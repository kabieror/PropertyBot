# KSK Data Provider

This provider crawles the [Kreissparkasse Böblingen](https://www.kskbb.de/de/home/privatkunden/immobilien/immobilienportal.html) for new properties. Every branch of the Kreissparkasse seems to use the same backend, so this 
provider should be able to crawl all properties of any Kreissparkasse.

## Configuration

The provider can be configured with the following environment variables. See the provided docker-compose.yml for examples.


### PROVIDER_KSK_ZIPS

**Mandatory**

The Zips, which are used as base for an area search. Accepts multiple zips delmited by a comma. *Example: 71254,70763*


### PROVIDER_KSK_PERIMETERS_IN_KM

**Optional. Default: 15**

The radius which is search arround the provided zip(s). There are two options here:

* Specify a single perimeter radius, which is used for all provided zips. *Example: 10*
* Specify for every provided zip a perimiter radius of its own. The amount of provided perimeters has to match the amount of provided zips. *Example: 15,10*

Only the following values are allowed (any other will cause the KSK Server to respond with a 500 status code): 1, 2, 5, 10, 15, 25, 50


### PROVIDER_KSK_LIMIT

**Optional. Default: 9**

The number of properties, which are retrieved at once. A higher number makes the crawling faster. *Caution: A limit > 10 is very instable and the KSK Server resonds most of the time with a 500 status code.*

### PROVIDER_KSK_MARKETING_USAGE_OBJECT_TYPES

**Optional. Default: buy_residential_property,buy_residential_house**

The type of properties to look for. If any others are needed, the KSK Website needs to be debugged.

### PROVIDER_KSK_REGIO_CLIENT_ID

**Optional. Default: 60350130**

The id of the client. The default value is the ID of the Kreissparkasse Böblingen.
